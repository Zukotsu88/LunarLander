# Lunar Lander
Lunar Lander is a game in which one tries to pilot a ship and make it land in between two poles on the lunar environment. 
This project utilizes Openai's [``gym``](http://gym.openai.com/docs/) and the simplification of ``baselines``, [``stablebaselines``](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html).
In doing so, it uses an implementation of ``stable_baseline``'s Deep Q Learning algorithm. 

To install openai's ``gym`` or ``stable baselines``, just use ``pip install gym`` and ``pip install stable_baselines`` in the command prompt.
